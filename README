This is a mern stack application

MERN Stack is a Javascript Stack that is used for easier and faster deployment of full-stack web applications. 
MERN Stack comprises of 4 technologies namely: MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js.
It is designed to make the development process smoother and easier.

Each of these 4 powerful technologies provides an end-to-end framework for the developers 
to work in and each of these technologies play a big part in the development of web applications.

This is a sample portfolio application

We have used the passport jwt for the cookie authentication and the cookie for a particular user expires in 24 h,
the session remains for 24 hours.
